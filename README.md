# Asymmetric flow with window

## Introduction
![topology](./topo.png)

Basic idea is that aymmetric flow detection reset itself after no traffic for a window of time. 

A register called window saves timestamp of the last packet for each flow. 

when a new packet arrives, if it's been longer than X seconds since the last packet on the same route, this trigger a reset in the asymmetric flow detection progress, and traffic resume as usual.

WINDOW  : 15 seconds

## DYNAMIC WINDOW SIZE 

Basic idea is using global_timestamp random bits to generate a dynamic size window.

Each time asymmetric flow count is reset, a new window size is generated by multipling a basic window size * [1-8]
this window size is valid until it is reached again. 

BASIC_WINDOW 15 seconds
